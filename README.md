# Pytorch pipeline

Custom package for streamlining boilerplate pytorch training pipeline setup.

Intended to be flexible, but it's generally oriented for simple vision tasks.

## Installation

The package is configured through `poetry`. Still debating whether this is a good idea, but for now the dependency management seems ok.

After setting up poetry per recommended guidelines, simply run:

```
poetry install
```

Then `poetry shell` will give you access to the project-specific virtual environment.
